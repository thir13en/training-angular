# Binding

In Angular, there are **three** types of data flow binding between template and controller:

1. Event Binding with the parentheses syntax.
1. Data Binding with the square bracket syntax.
1. Two way data binding with the Banana Box syntax.

### Binding event data with $event
To retrieve the data associated with an event, in Angular we use the `$event` keywork passed as parameter of the binded function in the template of the Component.
